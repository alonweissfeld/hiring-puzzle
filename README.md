# A fun puzzle from Sound Radix

The files `track-00.wav` up to `track-17.wav` in this repository are audio files containing different mixes of the same song.

Magic trick: If you import these mixes as tracks into your DAW and mix them together at specific levels, you will hear a secret message!

Did you discover the hidden message? Good!
